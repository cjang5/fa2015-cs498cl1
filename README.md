# Probability in Computer Science Datasets

This serves as the central place where datasets will be hosted for the
upcoming homework assignments.

Since I'm basically a one man army, pull requests are welcome, if you
are willing to help me populate this repository.

## Downloading this repository

If you know how to use git, then by all means, clone this repository
and feel free to `git pull` whenever new datasets or homework are updated.

If you don't know how to use git, you could still navigate to each
individual file on github's web interface, and download each individual
`csv` file. Alternatively, there's a "Download ZIP" button to the
right column of this page.

## Homework 1

Folder updated Monday, August 24th.

## Footnote

I'm perfectly aware that it's discouraged to version control datasets
and pdf files. But we'll use this system for now.
